I learned that Git and GitHub can be powerful tools to collaborate with others on projects. 
The most frustrating aspect for me is getting used to the commands and how to pull, commit, and push with Git.
I think developeres used Git as a way to document and organize their project and collaborate with others effectively. 
I plan on using this knowledge to create my own apps or websites, and work with others to create meaningful things together.
